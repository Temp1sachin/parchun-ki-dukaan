# Kirana Success Stories

## Bihar - Empowering Local Supply Chains
With Walmart micro-franchise support, local Kirana stores in Gaya doubled their monthly revenue during Chhath Puja by stocking essential SKUs like agarbatti, sweets, and lanterns in advance.

## Tamil Nadu - Festival-Centric Inventory
During Pongal, Walmart-predicted SKUs like jaggery and sambar masala were sent to local co-op Kirana partners. Predictive ML models helped avoid overstocking and achieve 30% more sell-through.

## Jharkhand - Women-led Kiranas
Micro-loans from Walmart enabled several women-led Kirana stores in Dhanbad to onboard cold storage for dairy SKUs. Local trust + Walmart supply = powerful rural reach.
